Facebook UX Teardown
====================

### 1. Who is the main user of Facebook?

Anyone with a desire to interact and stay relevant with other people.

### 2. What are the top 3 critical goals for that user?

i. Stay up-to-date on what acquaintances, friends, and family are doing (i.e. being relevant and connected) by looking at pictures, stories, links others post on their feed.

ii. Having the potential to "connect" and communicate with others (even if that potential is often not fully utilized).

iii. Let other people know your "status" (e.g. where you work, what city you live in, relationship status, etc.) and to figure the "status" of other people.

### 3. What is the site's approximate information architecture? (in general -- don't get caught up in the details too much)

### 4. For your top user goal, what is likely to make the user's experience particularly satisfying?

Having easy and instant access to the current events of the people the user is interested in.

### 5. To accomplish this goal, how does the user flow through the site's architecture? (ie. which pages are visited and what are clicked?)

Once the user logs in, they are presented with the search bar at the top, and the news feed page that takes the majority of the space in the middle of the page. The news feed contains the real-time posts/pictures/updates of all friends in chronological order (they can scroll down for older posts).

Since the goal of the user is to have instant access to all the current events of people of interest (i.e. staying connected), the user has already accomplished the goal by simply logging in and arriving at the news feed page.

To accomplish secondary goals, the user can simply type in the search bar to look for people to become friends with, then proceed to their profile page and just simply click the friend request CTA near the top of the profile.

### 6. What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the two key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?

The primary navigation style is the navigation bar at the top, which is always present no matter where the user is. It contains the facebook logo, the saerch bar, the user profile button, the home button, and other CTA's (in that order). The facebook logo and Home CTA's both take the user back to the news feed page, while the profile CTA takes the user to the user's own profile page. This helps the user reorient themselves if they get lost somewhere.

There are other ways to navigate the site, and require only a few minutes to get used to. For instance, at the bottom-right of the browswer, there is a chat sidebar which can be minimized if users are interested in chatting with friends that are online. However, most of the "navigation" is likely to be done via scrolling down the news feed and clicking or commenting on posts. Overall, the site is very flat in terms of the navigation flows required (i.e. minimal friction) to allow the user to accomplish their goals.


### 7. What does Facebook do well to allow the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?

The thing facebook does best to allow the user to accomplish their top goal is that there is minimal "friction" in UX. Users get to their desired place as soon as they log in, which means minimal clicking, thinking, navigating, etc.

The news feed page also allow users to continuously scroll down to look at older posts or things the user missed. This allows the user almost infinite access to everything that's been going on since the last login.

Facebook also controls the flow of information on the newsfeed and puts the posts/stories of most interest/relevance to the user at the top. This may aid in the user satisfaction area since facebook is feeding the user the most interesting and relevant information catered towards the tastes of the user.

### 8. What does Facebook do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?

Advertisements show up the newsfeed, and interrupt the user UX.
