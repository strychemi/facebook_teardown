Facebook Design Teardown
========================

The focus of this design teardown will be on the following key pages on Facebook (all visual diagrams were done in Google Draw):

1. Home page (when logged out)
------------------------------

### 1-2. Visual Hierarchy: what areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?

![alt text](https://github.com/strychemi/facebook_teardown/blob/master/pictures/FB_home.png)

The right hand side is definitely more dense than the left hand side.

### 3. Who is the most likely user of this page?

Anyone who does not have a facebook account or has one but is not logged in.

### 4. What is that user's critical goal on that page?

To login or make make an account.

### 5. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, there is a CTA at the bottom is for making an account, while there is a CTA at the top right for logging in after typing in username and password.

### 6. Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)?

**C**ontrast

The sign up CTA is huge, and in green, which sticks out of the overall blue hue of the home page. The login button is in a slightler lighter blue and is a stark contrast to the empty white credential fields to the left of the button.

**R**epitition

All of the form fields that the user must type in are done in helvetica and give the user a sense of consistency in terms of where the user can input their information.

**A**lignment

The whole sign up portion are aligned left on a single column and shows the user that it's one consistent section.

The login fields are aligned on the same line at the top and lead the user towards the login CTA at the right.

**P**roximity

The alignment gives each section their own area and helps control the user nav flow towards the respective CTA's.

### 7. What font families are most prominent on the page? (use WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

Everything is in helvetica except for the large "Sign Up" header and subheader which is in freight sans bold.

### 8. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The freight sans bold font family makes the "Sign Up" stick out more without giving it the obtrusiveness of an advertisement. Helvetica is base font and is clean and legible for the "business as usual" interactions.

### 9. How do the line spacings, sizes, and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

There are no major problems with the line spacings or sizes, they are just right for what the home page is trying to accomplishing.

### 10. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

As it is right now, it has a two column design. The left column describes its features or how it can help users accomplish what they want to do. The right column is the sign up area. I understand that the signup area is above the fold to increase the likelyhood of getting users to sign up, but I'd maybe consolidate the two columns into to a single column and maybe leave the signup either at the beginning or end of the column to increase flow.

2. News Feed page (after logging in)
------------------------------------

### 1-2. Visual Hierarchy: what areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?

![alt text](https://github.com/strychemi/facebook_teardown/blob/master/pictures/FB_newsfeed.png)

The left and right most columns are most dense while the middle column is more sparse.

### 3. Who is the most likely user of this page?

Anyone with a facebook account who has just logged in.

### 4. What is that user's critical goal on that page?

To read content/posts by others.

### 5. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, the middle column takes the majority of the screen real estate and the user can simply scroll down to see more content.

### 6. Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)?

**C**ontrast

The content/posts are boxed in white, and stick out due to their size and contrast to the grey/blue background. The white boxing show what's important on this page.

**R**epitition

All of the text font is in helvetica. The repitetive styling is what gives the page a sense of consistency allows the user to just scroll down continuing to expect the same "style" of content (in addition to the white boxing).

**A**lignment

Each column is dedicated to different things. Left most column is for groups, interests, etc. The center column is the news feed, and the right most column is the "reminder" and "trending" section.

Since the type of content is aligned properly within the appropriate column it helps the user achieve their goals.

**P**roximity

Similar comments to alignment.

### 7. What font families are most prominent on the page? (use WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

All text is in helvetica.

### 8. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

It gives the user a sense of consistency and increases the sense of flow, since no matter where the user is on the page it's the same style.

### 9. How do the line spacings, sizes, and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The posts in the newsfeed are spaced nicely to give each story its own space and to let the user know the end/start of a post. The line spacing within the posts are up to the user's discretion but the default line spacing is not too bad as long as the text is not a novel.

### 10. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

If the user is in a lot of groups, the left column may be a bit crowded while the right column will remain fairly empty creating a sort of "triangle" that points leads up to the search bar above. Not sure if this was intentional but I'd do something to balance out the visual "unevenness" of the left and right columns.

3. Profile Page
---------------

### 1-2. Visual Hierarchy: what areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?

![alt text](https://github.com/strychemi/facebook_teardown/blob/master/pictures/FB_profile.png)

Anything outside of the profile picture area seems to be more dense.

### 3. Who is the most likely user of this page?

Someone who is looking for more detailed information on another user or someone who wants to maybe check on how their own profile appear to others.

### 4. What is that user's critical goal on that page?

To find out detailed information on that person.

### 5. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, the profile and the background "cover" picture take the largest area of the screen, assuming the person in question has posted a picture that includes themselves in it. Everything below has information and posts that relate to that person.

### 6. Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)?

Overall, they do lead the user to learn more about the person. The alignment of the timeline (i.e. news feed) of that person can be scrolled down repititively to get more info on where the person has been or what they have posted. This information is aligned in the right column below the profile/cover picture section and takes most of the screen space.

### 7. What font families are most prominent on the page? (use WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

Again, evertyhing is in helvetica.

### 8. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Similar to last page comments.

### 9. How do the line spacings, sizes, and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Similar to last page comments.

### 10. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

Don't have any complaints for this page.


4. About Page
-------------

### 1-2. Visual Hierarchy: what areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?

![alt text](https://github.com/strychemi/facebook_teardown/blob/master/pictures/FB_about.png)

The page is overall very evenly spaced out.

### 3. Who is the most likely user of this page?

Someone who wants to know very specific details about the person or someone who wants to modify their own profile information.

### 4. What is that user's critical goal on that page?

Same answer given in #3, above.

### 5. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, Same explanation given in previous profile page.

### 6. Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)?

Yes, information about the user in question is grouped in various categories (e.g. friends, pictures, about, spots, places, etc.). Each of these categories more or less has a whole whitebox that surrounds it, and spans the whole screen, giving it utmost importance and simple flow. Users can simply scroll down for more information.

### 7. What font families are most prominent on the page? (use WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

Again, evertyhing is in helvetica.

### 8. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

5. Photos Page
--------------

### 1-2. Visual Hierarchy: what areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?

![alt text](https://github.com/strychemi/facebook_teardown/blob/master/pictures/FB_photos.png)

The photo album near the bottom of the page appear more dense than the rest of the page.

### 3. Who is the most likely user of this page?

Someone who wants to see pictures relevant to the person/user in question.

### 4. What is that user's critical goal on that page?

See answer to #3, above.

### 5. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, there's almost no text except the appropriate CTA's and headers. The rest is simply the picture album, which is very nice.

### 6. Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)?

Yes, the pictures are all aligned in a nice grid-like fashion and grouped very closely together in the middle of the page. This photo album contrasts nicely with the greyish-white background, assuming the colors are full of color.

### 7. What font families are most prominent on the page? (use WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

Again, evertyhing is in helvetica.

### 8. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

For this page, less text is better, which this page does well.

### 9. How do the line spacings, sizes, and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Similar to reason posted in #8, above.

### 10. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

Don't have any complaints for this page, does what it needs to do nicely and effectively.
