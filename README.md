Hi! This github repo contain my solutions to the final project of the [Web Design Basics](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-design-basics/tearing-down-and-mocking-up-facebook) part of the prep course required for the Viking Code School web dev program.

If you are interested in web dev, I highly recommend you go check them out: [Viking Code School](http://vikingcodeschool.com).

The appropriate solutions can be found in the respective markdown files in this repo. If you are in Github via browser, just click on the appropriate *.md file to view the solutions. The images have been embedded for convenience.

The pdf of the mockups can be found in the /mockups_pdf directory.
